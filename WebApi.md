# Web API

The ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices.
* Currently most mobile devices, browsers and tablets are the medium for accessing most of the internet and in this also people are using mobile apps the most and to provide data to apps we are now going to use the Microsoft new technology called Web API.
* If you want to expose the data/information of your application to your clients and other people then that other people can use your data and interact with the data/information you expose to them.
 
For example, a mobile application requires a service.
 
HTML 5 requires a service.
 
Desktop PC and tablets require services.
 
Currently most device apps require Web API services.
 
The ASP.Net Framework leverages both web standards such as HTTP, JSON and XML and it provides a simple way to build and expose REST based data services.
 
Some core concepts of ASP.Net MVC are similar to the ASP.Net Web API such as routing and controllers.

* The verbs themselves are included in the APIs, like Get Customers, Insert Invoice, Delete Customer, and that each of these endpoints end up being a separate URI.

Uses

* It is used to access service data in web applications as well as many mobile apps and other external devices.
* It is used to create RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications.
* It is primarily used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable, and support limited bandwidth.
* It is used to create a simple HTTP Web Service. It supports XML, JSON, and other data formats.

## RESTful services

* Web API is the enhanced form of a web application
* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) was an XML based protocol for developing the connected web applications.
* Problem with the SOAP was that with each request, Metadata is attached with data to be transferred.
* This Metadata converts small data to heavy data on the server.
* Web API may or may not be RESTful services, but they are always HTTP based services.
* In REST API, only the state of the object is sent to the server to find the desired result.
* REST is an architectural pattern for developing an API that uses HTTP as its underlying communication method.
