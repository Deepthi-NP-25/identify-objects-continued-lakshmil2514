# Caching
* Technique of storing frequently used data/information in memory
* Caching is extremely important for performance boosting in ASP.NET
* It is especially important for data related transactions, as these are expensive in terms of response time.
* The data will not be available in the following cases:

1. If its lifetime expires,
2. If the application releases its memory,
3. If caching does not take place for some reason.
* ASP.NET provides the following different types of caching:
a. Output Caching
b. Data Caching
c. Object Caching
d. Class Caching
e. Configuration Caching
