### Entity Framework in MVC

* Entity framework is essentially is a persistence framework that frees you from all the extra work
* We do not have to write any stored procedures, manage database connections, or manually mapping the database or table to the domain object. 
* The entity framework will do all these. 
* Therefore, if we want to access the database in our application, which we most often used, we used a persistent framework.
